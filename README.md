# AI4EO-GEOL0069 Week 4 Assignment 

## Assignment Overview

The objective of this task is to classify altimetry echoes into two surface types (sea ice and leads) using unsupervised learning methods applied to Sentinel-3 altimetry data. We will process waveform echoes to distinguish between these two classes and compute the average echo shape and standard deviation for each class in order to characterize their statistical and physical differences.
The classification workflow will build upon the provided notebook Chapter1_Unsupervised_Learning_Methods_Michel.ipynb
